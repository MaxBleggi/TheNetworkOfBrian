            The Network of Brian contains (and will contain more) neural networks.
            Each one is a variation on a convolution network.
            If you'd like to know more, go to the how it's made page.
            The name is a play on the movie, <i>The life of Brian</i> by Monty Python
            (seems appropriate considering it's implemented in Python, of which the language's name was coined from);
            furthermore, Brian is one character switch from Brain.
            Thusly, Network of Brian can be reasonably surmised to be a pseudonym for Brain (Neural) Network.

            It should also be stated that these networks are not optimized for optimal performance.
            I made them to experiment with and learn from not for production.
