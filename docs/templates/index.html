        <p class="indented">The Network of Brian contains (and will contain more) neural networks.
            Each one is a variation on a convolution network.
            If you'd like to know more, go to the how it's made page.
            The name is a play on the movie "The life of Brian" by Monty Python
            (seems appropriate considering it's implemented in Python, of which the language's name was coined from),
            and of course, Brian is one character switch from Brain.
            Thusly, Network of Brian can be reasonably surmised to be a pseudonym for Brain (Neural) Network.
